        <h1> Console Web App!!! </h1>
        <p> Visual Studio is a code editor where you can type code and create your very own games or apps! To set it up, you need to download it on the software you use (Windows or Mac). </p>
        <p> The console screen is a screen where you can see the codes and functions of a webpage or app that you make. You can consider it as a behind-the-scenes version of the app, and it is used to see the code and how the app was made. If you want to open the console screen, here is how you do it. After you live preview your creation, right click on the screen of the app and click "Inspect". At the top, click "Console", and then, you will be able to see the console screen. If you want to edit anything on the console screen, just go back to Visual Studio, edit whatever you need to edit, live preview the app again, and open the console screen. You will then be able to see the changes that you made on Visual Studio on the console screen. </p>
